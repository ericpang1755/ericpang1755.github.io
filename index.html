	Hello and welcome to my world! 
	My name is Eric Pang and I'm 18 years old. I am currently a freshman studying computer science at the University at Buffalo. 
	I'm from a little neighborhood called Fresh Meadows, which is in the northeastern part of Queens.
	My family consists of my parents, a younger sister, and myself.
	I plan change to change my major to business administration with a concentration in management information systems.
